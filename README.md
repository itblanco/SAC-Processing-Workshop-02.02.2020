#SAC Processing Workshop 02.02.2020
Processing and programming algorithms Workshop at the Staedelschule Architecture Class
-February 2nd 2020-

*The workshop will be based around the assumption that there is a fundamental shift in technological authority that comes from creating computer applications, instead of just using them. It will pay particular attention to the fundamental concepts of an Object-Oriented programming language (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism), and then touches on some more advanced techniques and algorithms. The Java-base 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle for the workshop, but trying to maintain some level of language agnosticism*
